/**
 * Offers this plugin's GitHub releases to WordPress as ordinary plugin updates.
 *
 * The plugin is not in the WordPress.org directory, so nothing tells WordPress that
 * a newer version exists. This fills that gap through the `Update URI` header and
 * the `update_plugins_{$hostname}` filter core added for exactly this case: core
 * asks us once per update check, we answer with the release metadata, and core does
 * the rest — the update row, the "update now" link, the bulk updater and the
 * automatic updater all work unchanged.
 *
 * Two details are what make the auto-update toggle appear rather than the greyed-out
 * "Auto-updates are not available for this plugin":
 *
 * - **An answer is returned even when the installed version is current.** Core files
 *   an up-to-date answer under `no_update` in the `update_plugins` transient, and
 *   the plugins screen decides a plugin supports updates by looking for it in either
 *   `response` or `no_update`. Answering only when an update exists would hide the
 *   toggle on every site that is already up to date — which is nearly all of them.
 * - **`package` is the built release asset**, so core can install it unattended.
 *   Without a package WordPress shows the new version but says an automatic update
 *   is unavailable.
 *
 * A check that fails — GitHub unreachable, no release carrying a manifest — returns
 * nothing at all, which reads on the plugins screen as "updates not available". That
 * is the honest answer: we could not ask. Any auto-update choice the site made is
 * kept in core's option and takes effect again as soon as a check succeeds.
