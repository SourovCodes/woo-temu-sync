# the WTSYNC_VERSION constant — and, at release time, in the git tag as well. A build
# whose header disagrees with its constant ships an update WordPress will not offer.
#
# Usage:
#   ./bin/check-version.sh          # header and constant agree
#   ./bin/check-version.sh v0.4.0   # …and both match the tag
